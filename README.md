# CHROMA (Color-based Halochromic Real-time Optical Monitoring using AI)

CHROMA (Color-based Halochromic Real-time Optical Monitoring using AI) is a mobile application designed to monitor the pH levels of chronic wounds in real time. The app integrates a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-based computational intelligence model, successfully deployed using TensorFlow Lite for efficient on-device inference. The application was developed using the Flutter framework to ensure cross-platform compatibility and a responsive user interface.

Main functions include:
- Image acquisition with segmentation mask
- Image processing
- AI-based pH prediction
- Data visualization
- Local data storage (SQLite)
- Data export (into an Excel file)

The app features three main screens: (1) Home screen, (2) Prediction results screen, and (3) Data visualization
